What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

t3events manages events. It provides integrators with the option to
display event items in a list or a single view. Each event can contain
one or more performances. For each performance, integrators have the
option to list as many ticket classes as needed as well as various
other information about the events. Performance locations can be
accorded the following meta information: address, link, image etc. A
teaser view is also available. A quick menu allows users to filter the
list view by genre.

The extension was built from scratch with extbase and fluid.

Originally designed to fulfill the specific requirements of a client
project, this extension remains under development. We appreciate any
feedback or suggestions for improvement.
