:Description:
      t3events manages events. It provides integrators with the option to display event items in a list or a single view. Each event can contain one or more performances. For each performance, integrators have the option to list as many ticket classes as needed as well as various other information about the events. Performance locations can be accorded the following meta information: address, link, image etc. A teaser view is also available. A quick menu allows users to filter the list view by genre. The extension was built from scratch with extbase and fluid. Originally designed to fulfill the specific requirements of a client project, this extension remains under development. We appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
